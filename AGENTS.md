# Agents — Project Name

Welcome to the data/application layer. This file serves as the main entry point for AI agents.

## Start Here

- [Docs Index](docs/README.md) — How the documentation is organized

<!-- - [Architecture Overview](docs/architecture/overview.md) — High-level design and layering -->

- [Rules Index](.agents/rules/README.md) — All agent rules organized by topic

## Project Overview

**[Project Name]** is a [short description of your project].

- **Core Technology**: [e.g., Next.js, Node.js, TypeScript, React.js, JavaScript]
- **Key Feature 1**: [Description]
- **Key Feature 2**: [Description]

## Where Skills and Rules Live

- **Rules — canonical home:** `.agents/rules/<name>.mdc` (the only git-tracked copy). The
  `.codex/rules/` trees are gitignored presentation mirrors containing relative symlinks back to `.agents/rules/`.

<!-- - **Skills — canonical home:** `skills-contrib/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`. `.codex/skills/` and `.agents/skills/` are symlink mirrors. -->

- **Rule/Skill edits:** Always edit the files at their canonical path, not via the symlink.

## Golden Rules

- Use `yarn`, or `npm`.
- Build with `yarn build` or `npm run build`.
- Never use `any` in TypeScript.
- Always write tests before creating or modifying implementation.
- Don't add comments if avoidable; prefer code that clearly expresses its intent.
- Keep documentation and rules current when changing features.

## Common Commands
